# SLOTTER 

**Split your time. Own your calls. Done.**

SLOTTER takes a block of total time, the number of calls you need to make, and optional buffer minutes, then outputs a clean schedule. No guessing. No wasted minutes.



## HOW TO USE

1. Open 'index.html' in a browser.
2. Enter:
     - **Total time** (minutes)
     - **Number of calls**
     - **Buffer time between calls** (optional, default= 2 min)
3. Click **Calculate**.
4. See your schedule. Copy it. Use it.



## WHY

Because time is finite and calls are endless. SLOTTER keeps your day from eating itself.
